BB_CONF_FRAGMENT_DESCRIPTION = "By default images are built such that root login is disabled \
(which is the preferred, secure default). However, for testing and development purposes it can \
be beneficial to be able to log in as root, both on serial console and over ssh connections, \
which is what this fragment enables. Use with great cauion, and ideally only in tightly \
controlled local builds and CI testing environments, and never in artefacts that are deployed \
into products. \
