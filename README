Patchtest
=========

Introduction
------------

Patchtest is a test framework for community patches based on the standard
unittest python module. As input, it needs tree elements to work propertly:
a patch in mbox format (either created with `git format-patch` or fetched
from 'patchwork'), a test suite and a target repository.

The first test suite intended to be used with patchtest is called patchtest-oe [1],
targeted for patches that get into the openembedded-core mailing list [2] correponding
to [3] repository.

Patchtest can either run on a host or a guest machine, depending on which environment
the execution needs to be done. If you plan to test your own patches (a good practice before
these are sent to the mailing list), the easiest way is to install and execute on your local
host; in the other hand, if automatic testing is intended, the guest method
is strongly recommended. Both methods are fully explained in doc folder.

Full documentation is located at the doc folder. Documentation is splitted into multiple
adoc files and these can be parsed and converted into a single html document using asciidoc [4]
on README.adoc file.
